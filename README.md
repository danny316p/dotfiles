dotfiles
========

A first attempt at gathering my dotfile preferences. This is off to a rather slow start.

Due to a lack of time, I'm ignoring the below for now and putting together a quick-and-dirty set of essentials to transfer elsewhere.

To do list:

1.	Actually finish looking at other people's dotfiles to determine what I want to use.
2.	Publish a document explaining the best practices I've found, and crediting examples of them.
3.	Implement a generic version of those best practices.
4.	Actually gather my own preferences

It appears that sections 2-4 will result in multiple different dotfile-based repositories instead of just the one.
